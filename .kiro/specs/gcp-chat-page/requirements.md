# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a dedicated chat page to the application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant powered by the Gemini API. The chat will be specialized for answering questions related to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and GCP certification topics, providing users with an interactive learning and support tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user studying for GCP certification, I want to access a chat interface where I can ask questions about GCP services, so that I can get immediate, contextual help with my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with input field and message history
2. WHEN the user enters a question about GCP services THEN the system SHALL send the query to the Gemini API with GCP-focused context
3. WHEN the Gemini API responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface with proper formatting
4. IF the user asks non-GCP related questions THEN the system SHALL gently redirect them to focus on GCP topics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user preparing for GCP certification, I want the chat to maintain conversation history during my session, so that I can reference previous questions and build upon the discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation history in the current session
2. WHEN the user scrolls through chat history THEN the system SHALL display all previous messages in chronological order
3. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL clear the chat history and start fresh
4. WHEN the chat history becomes long THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be responsive and provide feedback during API calls, so that I know the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a message THEN the system SHALL immediately display the user's message in the chat
2. WHEN the system is waiting for API response THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL disable the send button until there is text content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily navigate to the chat page from other parts of the application, so that I can quickly access GCP help when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on any page of the application THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to access the chat page
2. WHEN the user clicks the chat navigation link THEN the system SHALL route them to the chat page
3. WHEN the user is on the chat page THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current page in the navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat responses to be well-formatted and easy to read, so that I can quickly understand the information provided about GCP services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI responds with code examples THEN the system SHALL display them with proper syntax highlighting
2. WHEN the AI responds with lists or structured content THEN the system SHALL format them with appropriate spacing and bullets
3. WHEN the AI provides links or references THEN the system SHALL make them clickable and visually distinct
4. WHEN messages are long THEN the system SHALL ensure proper text wrapping and readability
