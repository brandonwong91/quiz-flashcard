# Design Document

## Overview

The GCP Chat Page feature will add a conversational AI interface to the existing GCP Developer Pro Prep application. This chat interface will leverage the existing Gemini API integration to provide users with an interactive way to ask questions about GCP services and certification topics. The design follows the existing application patterns and maintains consistency with the current UI/UX.

## Architecture

The chat feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing React application architecture:

- **Frontend**: React component with TypeScript following existing patterns
- **API Integration**: Extension of the existing `geminiService.ts` to support chat functionality
- **Routing**: New route added to the existing React Router setup
- **State Management**: Local React state for chat history and UI state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes consistent with existing design system

## Components and Interfaces

### ChatPage Component

- **Location**: `components/ChatPage.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main chat interface component
- **State Management**:
  - `messages`: Array of chat messages with sender identification
  - `currentMessage`: Current user input
  - `isLoading`: Loading state during API calls
  - `error`: Error state for failed requests

### Message Interface

```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  sender: "user" | "assistant";
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Chat Service Extension

- **Location**: Extension to `services/geminiService.ts`
- **Function**: `sendChatMessage(message: string, conversationHistory?: ChatMessage[]): Promise<string>`
- **Purpose**: Handle chat-specific API calls with GCP context

### Navigation Integration

- **Location**: Update to `App.tsx` header navigation
- **Icon**: MessageCircle from lucide-react
- **Route**: `/chat`

## Data Models

### ChatMessage

- `id`: Unique identifier for each message
- `content`: The actual message text content
- `sender`: Identifies if message is from 'user' or 'assistant'
- `timestamp`: When the message was created

### Chat Context

The system will maintain conversation context by:

- Sending recent message history to the API for context
- Limiting context to last 10 messages to manage token usage
- Prepending system prompt to focus on GCP topics

## Error Handling

### API Failures

- Display user-friendly error messages in chat interface
- Provide retry mechanism for failed requests
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

### Input Validation

- Prevent empty message submission
- Trim whitespace from user input
- Handle special characters and formatting

### Rate Limiting

- Implement basic client-side rate limiting
- Disable send button during API calls
- Show loading states appropriately

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test message formatting and display logic
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Test error state handling
- Mock API responses for consistent testing

### Integration Tests

- Test chat flow from user input to API response
- Test conversation history management
- Test navigation integration

### User Experience Tests

- Test responsive design across devices
- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Test loading states and error recovery

## UI/UX Design

### Layout

- Full-height chat interface with header, message area, and input
- Message bubbles with distinct styling for user vs assistant
- Auto-scroll to latest messages
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Message Formatting

- Support for markdown rendering in assistant responses
- Code syntax highlighting for GCP examples
- Clickable links in responses
- Proper text wrapping and spacing

### Visual Consistency

- Follow existing color scheme (blue primary, slate grays)
- Use existing shadow and border radius patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Integrate with existing loading spinner component

## System Prompt Design

The chat will use a specialized system prompt to:

- Focus responses on GCP services and certification topics
- Provide accurate, up-to-date information about GCP
- Redirect off-topic questions back to GCP context
- Format responses appropriately for the chat interface

Example system prompt:

```
You are a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) expert assistant helping users prepare for GCP certification exams and understand GCP services. Focus your responses on:
- GCP services and their use cases
- Best practices for GCP architecture
- Certification exam preparation
- Practical implementation guidance

If users ask about non-GCP topics, politely redirect them to GCP-related questions. Provide clear, concise answers with examples when helpful.
```

## Performance Considerations

### Message History Management

- Limit stored message history to prevent memory issues
- Implement efficient scrolling for long conversations
- Clear history on page refresh to start fresh

### API Optimization

- Send only necessary context to reduce token usage
- Implement request debouncing for rapid user input
- Cache common responses where appropriate

### Loading States

- Show typing indicators during API calls
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Maintain responsive UI during processing
